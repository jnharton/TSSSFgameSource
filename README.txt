butts

Somethings to keep in mind - if my programs delete, mutate, or otherwise make some change that you're not happy with,
sorry but that's something that happens sometimes when a program isn't ready yet. Hell, it happens sometimes when the
program is already finished! The point is... don't get too attached to any particular version, plus don't try to do
something that will obviously cause you more problems (like trying to edit a file that isn't a card...) and you SHOULD
be fine, but there's still a small chance something else might go wrong. I'll try to make sure that won't happen, mkay?

OK! With that out of the way, let's get down to the nitty-gritty.


==== INSTALLATION ====

Ok, so to help test this out in it's unfinished state, there's a few things that you'll need to install... I'm sorry :(

- Python 2.7.8    https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.8/python-2.7.8.msi (Do the full install)
- Pygame 1.9.2a0  http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame (Get the one that ends with win32-py2.7 and again keep clicking next)
- ...uh, there's probably something else I forgot, so you'll want to message me if you run into any issues.

Optional, but RECOMMENDED:
- GIT 2.1.0       http://git-scm.com/downloads

Optional Stuff:
- PIL 1.1.7       http://effbot.org/downloads/PIL-1.1.7.win32-py2.7.exe (This is only if you want to use the card editor)


==== USING GIT ====

Ok, so if you're reading this, it likely means you've already downloaded everything, but still...

TO DOWNLOAD THIS PROJECT WITH GIT:
  first find a location you'd like to download to.
  Right-click and click 'GIT Bash'. Then type in "git clone https://github.com/raubana/TSSSFgame.git".
  and press enter. It'll automatically create a folder for you called "TSSSFgame" and download the entire project to it.

TO UPDATE THE PROJECT:
  Right-click the "TSSSFgame" folder and open 'GIT Bash'. Type in 'git pull' and it should update (or otherwise tell you
  everything is up to date).

TO UPDATE THE PROJECT WHEN IT WON'T LET YOU BECAUSE GIT'S A BUTT:
  Ok, something important to note here -
  THIS WILL REMOVE EVERYTHING YOU'VE CHANGED OR ADDED SO THINGS LIKE CUSTOM CARDS WILL DISAPPEAR!!
  So yeah, make sure to move them out of the folder first.
  OK anyways, just like the previous one, right-click the "TSSSFgame" folder and click 'open GIT Bash'.
  There's two commands for this part: 'git fetch --all' followed by 'git reset --hard origin/master'.

I'll add more to this as time passes by.
