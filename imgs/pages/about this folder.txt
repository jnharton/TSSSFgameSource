This folder is where you will put the individual pages of cards that you need to be split.
BE CAREFUL, because you might overwrite existing split page files if you don't make the
names of the page files different from previous ones that have been processed already.

For instance, if you put a page called "a.png" into this folder called "pages" and run
the "page_splitter.py" file, 9 image files will appear in the "split pages" folder. Those
images will start with the name of the page they came from, followed by the
column and the row on that page. So the first card image from that page would have the
name "a_1_1.png", and the second card will have the name "a_2_1.png", the third will have
the name "a_3_1.png" then then forth will have "a_1_2.png" (because it's the next row) and
so on...

If a card image file already exists with one of those names, the program will simply
overwrite them.
